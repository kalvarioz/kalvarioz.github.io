                <h3>RANSOMWARE</h3>
                <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer system,
                    network, or data by encrypting files.
                    Attackers demand a ransom payment, typically in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, to restore access.
                    Modern attacks often involve stealing data before encryption, threatening to expose it if payment is
                    not made (double extortion)

                <p>
                    A Trojan virus (or Trojan horse) is a type of malicious software that disguises itself as
                    legitimate,
                    safe software to trick users into installing it. Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate, but
                    once activated, they can steal data, delete files,
                    spy on users, or allow unauthorized remote access to a computer.

                <h3>WORMS</h3>
                <p>A computer worm is a type of self-replicating, standalone malware that spreads across networks
                    without requiring human interaction or a host file. Unlike viruses, worms exploit security
                    vulnerabilities to
                    automatically copy themselves from computer to computer, often causing significant damage by
                    consuming bandwidth and overloading system</p>

                <p>A computer virus is
                    a type of malicious software (malware) designed to spread between computers by attaching itself to
                    legitimate programs, files, or documents. Once executed,
                    it replicates by inserting its code into other files, causing damage to data, stealing information,
                    or disrupting system performance. They often rely on user action, such as opening an
                    infected email attachment or clicking a link, to spread. </p>

                <p>
                    A rootkit is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to provide unauthorized,
                    administrative-level access to a computer while actively hiding its presence from users, operating
                    systems, and security software
                    . The term is derived from "root" (the top-level, privileged account in Unix/Linux) and "kit" (the
                    software components that facilitate this access).
