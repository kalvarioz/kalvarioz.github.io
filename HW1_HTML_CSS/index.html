                <p>Malware is a series of malicious software that has the capability to spread between computers and
                    causes
                    potential damage to data and computers. It is the largest threat to online programming and networks,
                    and since then, there have been some unique varints of these softwares, each having a purpose or
                    style of attacking their target (such as being hidden, and stealing resources and data, or going
                    brute and encrypting a users files for ransom, along with other techniques). This page provides a
                    simple overview of these types.

                <p>Generally, malware has the capability to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer
                    network.
                    From here, it can leak private information, gain and block access to IT or administrative systems.
                    Depending on the malware, it may or may not be able to be detected by antiviruses and the user
                    themselves.

                    <h3>RANSOMWARE</h3>
                    <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer
                        system,
                        network, or data by encrypting files.
                        Attackers demand a ransom payment, typically in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, to restore access.
                        Modern attacks often involve stealing data before encryption, threatening to expose it if
                        payment is
                        not made (double extortion).

                    <p>
                        Spyware is malicious software that secretly infiltrates your device to gather personal
                        information
                        and activities, sending it to unauthorized third parties, often for financial gain, identity
                        theft,
                        or marketing, by monitoring keystrokes, capturing data like passwords and credit card numbers,
                        tracking location, and even accessing your camera and microphone.

                    <p>
                        A Trojan virus (or Trojan horse) is a type of malicious software that disguises itself as
                        legitimate,
                        safe software to trick users into installing it. Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate,
                        but
                        once activated, they can steal data, delete files,
                        spy on users, or allow unauthorized remote access to a computer.

                    <p>A computer worm is a type of self-replicating, standalone malware that spreads across networks
                        without requiring human interaction or a host file. Unlike viruses, worms exploit security
                        vulnerabilities to
                        automatically copy themselves from computer to computer, often causing significant damage by
                        consuming bandwidth and overloading systems.

                        by
                        attaching itself to legitimate programs, files, or documents. Once executed,
                        it replicates by inserting its code into other files, causing damage to data, stealing
                        information,
                        or disrupting system performance. They often rely on user action, such as opening an
                        infected email attachment or clicking a link, to spread.

                    <p>
                        A rootkit is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to provide unauthorized,
                        administrative-level access to a computer while actively hiding its presence from users,
                        operating
                        systems, and security software. The term is derived from "root" (the top-level, privileged
                        account
                        in Unix/Linux) and "kit" (the software components that facilitate this access).
